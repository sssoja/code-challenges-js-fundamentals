<h1>for...of</h1>
<ol>
<li>Write a for...of loop that iterates through our pokemonList array.</li>

<li>Inside the block of the <code>for...of</code> loop, use console.log() and string interpolation as modeled above to log each element in the pokemon array within the string 'You caught a 'X'!' For example, the first iteration of the loop should print ‘You caught a Pikachu!’ to the console.</li>

<li>One of the elements, <code>'Yoshi'</code>, is not a Pokemon. If you encounter <code>'Yoshi'</code>, use continue to skip this element before it is logged to the console.</li>
</ol>

<p>The next time you need to iterate through an array, string, or array-like object and don’t need to access the index, consider trying out for...of to keep your code succinct and readable.</p>
